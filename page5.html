            <p>Ceres (/ˈsɪəriːz/;[19] minor-planet designation: 1 Ceres) is the largest object in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, slightly closer to Mars's orbit. With a diameter of 945 km (587 mi),[6] Ceres is the largest of the minor planets and the only dwarf planet inside Neptune's orbit. It is the 33rd-largest known body in the Solar System.</p>
            <p>Ceres is composed of rock and ice and is estimated to comprise approximately one-third of the mass of the entire asteroid belt.[21] Ceres is the only object in the asteroid belt known to be rounded by its own gravity (though detailed analysis was required to exclude Vesta). From Earth, the apparent magnitude of Ceres ranges from 6.7 to 9.3, peaking once in opposition every 15 to 16 months[22] (its synodic period); thus even at its brightest, it appears too dim to be seen by the naked eye, except under extremely dark skies.</p>
